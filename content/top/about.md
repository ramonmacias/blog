The passion for technology and innovation motivated me to study my degree in Computer Science. After a few years of experience, I still have the same impulse for learning new things every day, therefore I consider myself a person who adapts easily to new challenges.

I am also a nature and sports lover that makes me have a good balance in my personal and professional life. In addition, I love to discover new cultures through their cuisine and nature.

Iâ€™m looking forward always to start a new project that allows me to keep pursuing my passion as well as I increase my Computer Science knowledge abroad.

My name is **Ramon Macias** and this is my personal blog where I will try to share what I learned as a computer engineer, and also I will use it as a tool for keep improving my english skills, what is for me one of the key skill you should have if you want to be a better engineer.
